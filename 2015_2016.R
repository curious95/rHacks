#c
# Use par(mfrow=c(1,2)) to create a 1Ã—2 plotting matrix. The left-hand plot should
# contain a boxplot of the number of reviews for the books published in 2014. The
# right hand plot should contain a boxplot of the number of reviews for the books
# published published prior to 2014. Label axes, include titles and use colour. Ensure
# the limits of the y axes match in the two plots. Comment on the resulting plots.
